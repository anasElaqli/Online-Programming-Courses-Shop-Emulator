# Programming-Courses-Oline-Shop-Emulator

This project emulates an online shop that sells programming courses. It focuses on the site owner's backend side functions such as adding users and course information to the database and deleting, editing, displaying it, etc. Using both Java and MySQL.

The project was an international group project for a university subject called Methodology of Programming II. It was a collaboration between me and 2 of my classmates, Dita Pelaj from Kosovo and Egor Kolonyuk from Australia under the supervision of Iranian professor Zahra Ahmadipour. The project uses Java and MySQL and also was an opportunity to use technologies such as Spring Framework and Swagger.
